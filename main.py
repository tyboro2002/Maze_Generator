# TODO Iterative randomized Kruskal's algorithm (with sets)
# Create a list of all walls, and create a set for each cell, each containing just that one cell.
# For each wall, in some random order:
#   If the cells divided by this wall belong to distinct sets:
#      Remove the current wall.
#      Join the sets of the formerly divided cells.

# TODO wilson's algorithm
# We begin the algorithm by initializing the maze with one cell chosen arbitrarily.
# Then we start at a new cell chosen arbitrarily, and perform a random walk until we reach a cell already
# in the mazeâ€”however, if at any point the random walk reaches its own path, forming a loop, we erase the loop from the
# path before proceeding. When the path reaches the maze, we add it to the maze. Then we perform another loop-erased
# random walk from another arbitrary starting cell, repeating until all cells have been filled.

# TODO Recursive division method
# Mazes can be created with recursive division, an algorithm which works as follows: Begin with the maze's space with
# no walls. Call this a chamber. Divide the chamber with a randomly positioned wall (or multiple walls) where each wall
# contains a randomly positioned passage opening within it. Then recursively repeat the process on the subchambers until
# all chambers are minimum sized. This method results in mazes with long straight walls crossing their space, making
# it easier to see which areas to avoid.
#
# For example, in a rectangular maze, build at random points two walls that are perpendicular to each other. These two
# walls divide the large chamber into four smaller chambers separated by four walls. Choose three of the four walls at
# random, and open a one cell-wide hole at a random point in each of the three. Continue in this manner recursively,
# until every chamber has a width of one cell in either of the two directions.

# TODO Fractal Tessellation algorithm
# On each iteration, this algorithm creates a maze twice the size by copying itself 3 times.
# At the end of each iteration, 3 paths are opened between the 4 smaller mazes.
